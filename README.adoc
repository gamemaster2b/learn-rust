=== Constants

Constants are declared using the 'const' keyword are immutable. +
They can not be made mutable.
Adding 'mut' will result in a compile time error.

include::variables/src/main.rs[tag=constants-a]

main() {
include::variables/src/main.rs[tag=constants-b]
}

=== shadowing

Shadowing is the declaration of new variable using the name of a preexisting variable. +
The compiler identifies the second variable by the name until it leaves the scope or the second variable shadowed by another
